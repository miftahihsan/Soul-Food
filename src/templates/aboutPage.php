      With the busy city life taking a toll on its citizens what most people now miss is home-cooked meals. People are too busy to make their own food and thus often have to resort to restaurants or get food that are not as hygienic. Soulfood aims to create a platform to connect the people who want these food items with those who cook them at the comfort of their own homes. A web app will be developed for this. This project was mainly planned for our CSE-471 course, but with the promise it holds, the web app can be used on a massive scale and be very profitable. We have filled a System request form and also conducted feasibility analysis of our project.

      <hr>
      <p>As the modern life gets busier, most people do not have time to cook their own food and have to rely on restaurants. However, people still crave the freshness of homemade cooking.On the other hand, there are also great home cooks who love spending time in the kitchen and although they do not want a straining full time job, they would be happy to cook sometimes and be self-employed.  The purpose of our project is to provide a platform for home cooks to sell their products while giving busy buyers an opportunity to taste homemade cooking. Our goal is to earn profit from this and expand into a social media platform for people who have a passion for cooking but don't necessarily have the means or opportunity to have a formal business. The project is initiated to increase sales so that we have higher profit, improve customer service over time by taking public opinion through campaigns and user opinion, improve efficiency of the system, keeping a database of the information to be able to analyse it and improve our quality in the future.

          <li> <p>The Youtube channel for our website which will be featuring tutorials on different dishes and food preparation techniques will help gain money from views and subscriptions.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li> <p>Adding a percentage to the amount posted by the cook will help us to gain profits from each transaction that takes place through the website.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li> <p> Displaying advertisements on website will add more earnings for the company.

      <h1><b>Special issues and constraints:</b></h1>
      <hr>
      <p>

        <ul>
          <li> <p>Strict regulations are needed to maintain the quality of the foods cooked. Sellers must register for a hygiene check-up of the kitchen that they will use. Our employees will do that checkup to ensure that they meet standards.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li> <p>The buyers and sellers can use our delivery system in which case they will be charged an extra 60Tk fee, or they can come up with their own delivery system.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li> <p>Orders must be cancelled at least a day before. Otherwise, compensations have to be given.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li> <p>Proper standards need to be followed while dealing with complaints so a user policy needs to be made.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li> <p>Because there is cookups as competition, our website needs to be of top quality to attract more people.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li> <p>Heavy advertising would be needed to get people to visit the website.
              </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
